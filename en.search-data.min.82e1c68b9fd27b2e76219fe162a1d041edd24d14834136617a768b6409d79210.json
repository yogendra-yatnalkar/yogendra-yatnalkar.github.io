It is a machine learning (ML) service that spots defects and anomalies in visual representations of manufactured products using computer vision (CV), allowing users to automate quality inspection. ML model is trained to spot anomalies from live production line with as few as 30 images for the process which needs to be visually inspected — with no machine learning experience required. Now, in addition to detecting anomalies in the cloud, Amazon LFV model can be hosted on edge using AWs IoT Greengrass V2 compatible edge devices.\nPrerequisite:\n→ Train a Lookout For Vision Model using AWS Console\n→ Compile and package the model for edge hosting\n→ The below work has been tested on EC2 instance and SageMaker Notebook Instance (EC2 instance as edge) having Nvidia T4 GPU (instance — G4dn.xlarge)\nOnce training and packaging the trained model is complete, our journey starts here.\nWe try to trace-back the service to identify how the LFV service trains its anomaly detection model, what post-processing it performs on the trained model and if there is any minute chance of custom hosting it for inference.\nTHE JOURNEY BEGINS:\r#\rA. Model Packaging:\r#\rA model packaging job packages an Amazon Lookout for Vision model as a model component. While packaging your custom trained model, there is an option for target-device and target-platform. Since we are testing this on EC2 instance, we will choose our target as: target-platform in this case.\nAfter choosing the platform, we will choose compiler-options. Within compiler option, we will have to provide the GPU which we will be using, the tensorrt version and the Cuda library version. For more details, please follow the documentation at the following link: LINK\rOur configuration for G4dn.xlarge Instance:\n{‘gpu-code’: ‘sm_75’, ‘trt-ver’: ‘7.1.3’, ‘cuda-ver’: ‘10.2’}\nSo here comes our first clue, the service is post-processing our model by optimizing it using NVIDIA TensorRT SDK.\nQuestion: We still do not know if the following model is trained using Tensorflow or Pytorch or any other Deep Learning framework… !!\nB. Analyzing Zipped model\r#\rImage Description: Zipped Model Contents\nZipped Model contents\nOnce the model is trained → compiled → TensorRT optimized, it gets saved to AWS S3 in a zipped format. In our case, the zip file and contents within the zip looked something like image above:\nIf we closely observe, there are two things inside it:\nFolder — “mochi” (including the sub-files within this folder) manifest.json file The manifest.json file contains the following contents:\n{\u0026ldquo;model_graph\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;model_graph_type\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;single_stage_model_graph\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;stages\u0026rdquo;: [{\u0026ldquo;class_normal_ids\u0026rdquo;: [1], \u0026ldquo;seg_normal_ids\u0026rdquo;: [], \u0026ldquo;classification_head_enabled\u0026rdquo;: true, \u0026ldquo;segmentation_head_enabled\u0026rdquo;: false, \u0026ldquo;threshold\u0026rdquo;: 0.7021560668945312, \u0026ldquo;normalize\u0026rdquo;: true, \u0026ldquo;image_range_scale\u0026rdquo;: true, \u0026ldquo;image_width\u0026rdquo;: 1000, \u0026ldquo;image_height\u0026rdquo;: 1000, \u0026ldquo;input_shape\u0026rdquo;: [1, 3, 1000, 1000], \u0026ldquo;type\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;mochi\u0026rdquo;}], \u0026ldquo;image_level_classes\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;names\u0026rdquo;: [\u0026ldquo;anomaly\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;], \u0026ldquo;normal_ids\u0026rdquo;: [1]}, \u0026ldquo;pixel_level_classes\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;names\u0026rdquo;: [], \u0026ldquo;normal_ids\u0026rdquo;: []}}, \u0026ldquo;compilable_models\u0026rdquo;: [{\u0026ldquo;filename\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;mochi.pt\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;data_input_config\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;input\u0026rdquo;: [1, 3, 1000, 1000]}, \u0026ldquo;framework\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;PYTORCH\u0026rdquo;}], \u0026ldquo;dataset\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;image_width\u0026rdquo;: 1000, \u0026ldquo;image_height\u0026rdquo;: 1000}}\nThe Analysis from the folder and JSON file is as follows:\r#\rThe folder name itself is quite unique and hence raises a question: Could “mochi” be some latest/open-source model ? The JSON file contains a key-word named: “mochi.pt” Web-searching on the “mochi” term led to an interesting discovery. It resulted in the following paper: Hard Negative Mixing for Contrastive Learning (Paper Link)\rwhere MoCHI stands for “(M)ixing (o)f (C)ontrastive (H)ard negat(i)ves”. The paper proposes a semi-supervised way of training Deep Learning models using Contrastive Loss where it highlights the importance of “Hard-negatives”. The proposed approach generates synthetic hard negatives on-the-fly for each positive (query). (Note: Please read about contrastive loss and semi-supervised learning for more details …… this was first time for me as-well😢) Illustration of MoCHi\nIt could be assumed that Lookout for Vision has a pre-trained semi-supervised defect detection model. For new model training on customer data, this pre-trained model is further fine-tuned on new data and saved. Hence, this can be also related to the unique feature of the service, which is the need for a very small amount of annotated data as it could be using semi-supervised learning algorithm internally.\nContent within manifest.json file…\nNow, lets have a quick peek at content.json file:\nIt tells us that the trained model is a “Pytorch” model with model name as: mochi.pt. The model is trained and inferred on shape: 1000x1000x3 Even though the service only supports binary classification, the model has 2 output neurons. One output states whether the input image is “normal” or not. Another output states whether the input image is “anomaly” or not. The threshold for detecting output is set at: **0.7021 (at-least to the model trained in our case)\n**- There is key-value pair named: → “normalized”: True. From here, we can assume that the output of the last layer is Normalized using Softmax layer. Now, lets quickly analyze the other sub-files from the “mochi” folder.\nThe libdlr.so file and dlr.h file tells us that the model is compiled using Neo-AI-DLR package (LINK).\r- DLR is a compact, common runtime for deep learning models and decision tree models compiled by AWS SageMaker Neo\r, TVM\r, or Treelite\r. DLR uses the TVM runtime, Treelite runtime, NVIDIA TensorRT™, and can include other hardware-specific runtimes. The libdlr.so file in the model zip specifies the platform details of the compiled model while custom loading in NeoAI-dlr. Hence, it’s required while loading the model on any g4dn.xlarge instance (Nvidia T4 GPU) (Note: Our model was compiled for Nvidia T4 GPU)\nC. Edge Model Custom Loading:\r#\rWe have learnt a lot about this model now. Somehow, lets crack the hidden mystery on how to load it manually without using AWS SDK….\nRequirements:\r#\rInstance with Nvidia T4 GPU (Tested on SageMaker Notebook and EC2 instance of type: g4dn.xlarge) DLR\rinstalled with GPU support. It can be installed by building from source or using **pip with pre-built binaries. (**on development instance, it was installed using: pip install {prebuilt supported binary} ) Edge model zip file locally available and unzipped. Python libraries required: dlr, numpy, cv2, os, torch Image pre-processing before inference:\r#\r(IMPORTANT NOTE: The below listed pre-processing was found using multiple trial and error by comparing custom loaded model inference with the console displayed information)\nRead the image using Opencv (cv2) image library Convert BGR channel image to RGB channel image (Opencv image are read in BGR channel) Resize the image to size: 1000x1000 (3 channel) Normalize the image between scale: 0–1 (divide by 255) Standardize the image with **ImageNet channel wise mean and standard deviation (order: RGB): mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406] standard-deviation (std) =[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]** Make the image channel first (Earlier: 1000x100x3, After: 3x1000x1000) Expand image dimension to treat it as batch size 1 for inference. (final dimension: 1x3x1000x1000) Model Loading and Inference:\r#\rWe have finally analyzed multiple things and came to few major conclusions, such as:\nThe training is performed using Pytorch Library The model is TensorRT optimized The model is compiled using NeoAI-DLR package for Nvidia GPU The trained model is a Semi-supervised model (MOCHI) Inference Image Size: 1000x1000x3 Image Pre-processing decoded(mean, standard-deviation, order of image channel) Code to load the model using DLR package and inference. lookout_for_vision_custom_loading.py · GitHub\rimport dlr import numpy as np import cv2 import os # DLR installation # pip install https://neo-ai-dlr-release.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1.10.0/gpu/dlr-1.10.0-py3-none-any.whl # Load model. # /path/to/model is a directory containing the compiled model artifacts (.so, .params, .json) model = dlr.DLRModel(\u0026#39;./mochi/\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gpu\u0026#39;, 0) def process_image(img): # normalizing the image (0-1) and # standardizing with ImageNet Mean and Std-deviation img = img/255 img[:,:,0] = (img[:,:,0] - 0.485)/0.229 img[:,:,1] = (img[:,:,1] - 0.456)/0.224 img[:,:,2] = (img[:,:,2] - 0.406)/0.225 # convert image to channel first from channel last img = img.transpose(2,0,1) # Expanding dimension to treat it as batch-size: 1 img = np.expand_dims(img, axis = 0) return img def predict_on_image(img_path, model): # read image and convert to RGB img = cv2.imread(img_path) img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) # resize the images if needed # Process image img = process_image(img) # infer and print result y = model.run(img) return round(y[0][0][0], 3), round(y[0][0][1], 3), np.argmax(y) folder_path = \u0026#39;./temp/\u0026#39; for img_name in sorted(os.listdir(folder_path)): if(\u0026#39;.jpg\u0026#39; not in img_name): continue img_path = os.path.join(folder_path, img_name) print(img_name) a,b,c = predict_on_image(img_path, model) print(c,\u0026#39;====\u0026#39;, a,b) We were able to successfully load and infer on our test images using the above attached code. To validate our work, we performed one experiment on it which is as follows:\n— Took one image data-set and converted it to train and test set\n— Train the model on train-set using AWS console and package it for edge such that its zip file is saved in S3. Fetch the zip file and store it in test-environment\n— Infer the model on the cloud using the AWS Console on the test-set. Record its results and model confidence\n— Now, infer using the edge-model on the testing instance using the above code on the test-set images. Record the results and confidence score\nResult:\r#\rWe observed that, when the test-set was inferred on the edge using custom loading of the model, the inference results and the confidence scores were exactly identical as compared with the AWS LFV Console inference.\nWith this in hand, we can easily see how much cost we could save in future, as we will only have to bear the training cost and avoid all the AWS API/SDK inference cost. Lets say, we are on a NVIDIA Jetson device and we have trained a AWS LFV model, we will be able to directly infer on new images/video-frames using custom loading.\nIf you have actually read this much and liked it, please do not forget to give a clap and subscribe for future articles…..\nTHE END…..\nTags AWS, Computer Vision, Pytorch, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing "},{"id":1,"href":"/blogs/finding-nth-aggregate-from-every-group-aws-athena.html","title":"Finding the n’th Aggregate Value from Every Group in AWS Athena/Presto","section":"Blogs","content":"\rFinding the n’th Aggregate Value from Every Group in AWS Athena/Presto\r#\rCo-Author: Palash Nimodia\rDate: June 2, 2022\nMedium Link: https://medium.com/selectfrom/finding-the-nth-aggregate-value-from-every-group-in-aws-athena-presto-1da505310901\rPrerequisite:\r#\rBefore going ahead, a quick read for those who don’t know what AWS Athena and Presto are.\nAWS Athena: Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is easy to use, fast, scalable and serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and we pay only for the queries that we run. We also don’t have to pay for failed queries. This makes it easy for anyone with SQL skills to quickly analyze large-scale datasets.\nPresto: Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. AWS Athena uses Presto internally as its query engine.\nIntroduction:\r#\rContinuing on with our main focus, today we will discuss finding the nth aggregate value from every group in AWS Athena/Presto).\nLet’s take an example: finding some aggregate value from every group in SQL is possible and its solutions are quite easily available. Across the few solutions that I went through, two things were common:\nIt always referred to the 2nd highest/lowest. Most of the solutions used SQL variables and inner join. Now imagine a scenario where you are required to find the 5th…. 6th…. nth largest/smallest/aggregate value from every group where data size is HUGE (in TB’s) and you are restricted from using SQL variables.\nIn such scenarios, due to the sheer scale, inner-join will be a very heavy operation and hence its best to avoid it. Another restriction being the use of variables in AWS Athena. Since AWS Athena is used for data analytics and not transactional databases, the use of variables is not supported as of now.\nSo after the above discussion, is there any other way ??? …… Yes, there is. Let’s have a quick look at the dummy data-set first and then move onto our solution.\nThe dummy data-set has 1,000 rows and 4 columns. The “id” column has 10 unique values of type varchar. The “date” column is of type date-type. The “class-type” column is of data-type varchar containing values namely: “extra”, “vip”, “normal”. The “class-marks” column contains integers ranging between 0 and 100.\nThis is how the dummy data-set looks\nData Download: The dummy data-set is very small in size and it is uploaded on GitHub — augmented-data.csv\rLet’s define a question now:\nQuestion 1:\r#\rFor every ID, find the 5th highest scorer from every unique “class-type”.\nPre-work: The above data-set is uploaded on AWS S3 and crawled using AWS Glue. This crawled table is now easily accessible using AWS Athena.\nSolution:\r#\rLet’s divide the solution into 3 parts, hence containing 3 nested queries. (The entire query is attached at part 3)\nPart 1:\r#\r— — — — — —\nAs we are required to compute the highest scorer, we will need to sort the table based on marks in descending order. The query to perform that will be as follows:\n— — — — — —\nQuery1:\r#\rWITH \u0026#34;sorted_marks_table\u0026#34; AS( SELECT * FROM \u0026#34;augmented_data\u0026#34; ORDER BY \u0026#34;augmented_data\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;class-marks\u0026#34; DESC ) SELECT * FROM \u0026#34;sorted_marks_table\u0026#34;; Query1 Output:\r#\raugmented_data table in sorted order\nPart2:\r#\r— — — — — —\nIn the next part, let’s work on grouping. We need to compute the highest scorer for every ID, hence we will need to group by on the ID column. In this sub-query, we will create a mapping (you can imagine a hash-map/dictionary) between “class-type” and “class-marks” column and group by on “id” column. It will be such that for every unique id the map key will be unique class type and value will be a list consisting of all the marks associated with that id and class name.\nPlease observe the output image, since we had already sorted the table based on marks in the earlier sub-query, the value list is also sorted in the highest to lowest marks(descending).\n— — — — — —\nQuery2 (In combination with Query1):\r#\rWITH \u0026#34;sorted_marks_table\u0026#34; AS( SELECT * FROM \u0026#34;augmented_data\u0026#34; ORDER BY \u0026#34;augmented_data\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;class-marks\u0026#34; DESC ), \u0026#34;mapping_table\u0026#34; AS ( SELECT id, multimap_agg(\u0026#34;class-type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;class-marks\u0026#34;) AS \u0026#34;mapping_col\u0026#34; FROM \u0026#34;sorted_marks_table\u0026#34; GROUP BY \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; ) SELECT * FROM \u0026#34;mapping_table\u0026#34;; Query2 Output:\r#\rTable grouped on “id” column such that all the marks are associated with the unique class-types.\nPart3 (Final):\r#\r— — — — — —\nNow, in the final part we just need to display the required results from our map. As we have all the marks in sorted order for every class type and we need the 5th highest scorer, we will select the 5th place value from every key of the map.\nOne caveat of this solution is that we need to know the unique keys beforehand and need to explicitly specify the key-name. But there is a reason behind this, unlike some programming languages like Python or Java, we are using a form of SQL and we need to know the schema of the Database before-hand.\n— — — — — —\nQuery3:\r#\rWITH \u0026#34;sorted_marks_table\u0026#34; AS( SELECT * FROM \u0026#34;augmented_data\u0026#34; ORDER BY \u0026#34;augmented_data\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;class-marks\u0026#34; DESC ), \u0026#34;mapping_table\u0026#34; AS ( SELECT id, multimap_agg(\u0026#34;class-type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;class-marks\u0026#34;) AS \u0026#34;mapping_col\u0026#34; FROM \u0026#34;sorted_marks_table\u0026#34; GROUP BY \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; ) SELECT \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;, mapping_col [ \u0026#39;normal\u0026#39; ] [ 5 ] as \u0026#34;normal_max_5th\u0026#34;, mapping_col [ \u0026#39;vip\u0026#39; ] [ 5 ] as \u0026#34;vip_max_5th\u0026#34;, mapping_col [ \u0026#39;extra\u0026#39; ] [ 5 ] as \u0026#34;extra_max_5th\u0026#34; FROM \u0026#34;mapping_table\u0026#34;; Query3 Output:\r#\rFinal output containing the 5th highest marks from every‘ class-type’ for every ‘id’\nThat’s it! We are done and dusted. We have found the 5th largest scorer for every id for every “class-type”.\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\nAre we not done? Why is this blog not ending here?\nLet’s try computing another very similar question.\nQuestion2:\r#\rFor every ID, find the 3rd lowest scorer from every unique “class-type”\r#\rSolution:\r#\rWITH \u0026#34;sorted_marks_table\u0026#34; AS( SELECT * FROM \u0026#34;augmented_data\u0026#34; ORDER BY \u0026#34;augmented_data\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;class-marks\u0026#34; ), \u0026#34;mapping_table\u0026#34; AS ( SELECT id, multimap_agg(\u0026#34;class-type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;class-marks\u0026#34;) AS \u0026#34;mapping_col\u0026#34; FROM \u0026#34;sorted_marks_table\u0026#34; GROUP BY \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; ) SELECT \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;, mapping_col [ \u0026#39;normal\u0026#39; ] [ 3 ] as \u0026#34;normal_max_3rd\u0026#34;, mapping_col [ \u0026#39;vip\u0026#39; ] [ 3 ] as \u0026#34;vip_max_3rd\u0026#34;, mapping_col [ \u0026#39;extra\u0026#39; ] [ 3 ] as \u0026#34;extra_max_3rd\u0026#34; FROM \u0026#34;mapping_table\u0026#34;; Question2 Output:\r#\rFinal output containing the 3rd lowest marks from every‘ class-type’ for every ‘id’\nSo what did we change:\nWe sorted the table in ascending order in the first part of the query and selected the 3rd element this time.\nThat’s it!

We just need to engineer it accordingly.\nTrained ON: 11 million images and 1 billion corresponding masks\nEarlier foundation model: Clip and Align \u0026raquo; Now getting used in other downstream tasks like image generation (DALL-E).\nTo build foundation mode, 3 things are necessary:\nTask\nModel\nDataset and Data-Engine\nTask\r#\rTask: Prompt-able segmentation task \u0026raquo; prompt can be text or mask or BB or points \u0026raquo; even if prompt is not accurate or it is confusing, the output should be good.\nZero-shot transfer: Example- if you have a OD model to detect cats, SAM can be used to segment each cat (instance segmentation) in your image. If you want semantic segmentation, convert that cat instances to single class.\nSAM vs Other multi-segmentation models:\nOther models are not general. They do a set of predefined tasks they are trained on, they can be many but fixed.\nIn case of SAM, it can be engineered to perform any task with itself alone or with other systems (example: OD model or older segmentation model). The prompt makes it key here and forms a general foundation model.\nModel:\r#\rModel: Heavy and powerful image encoder, light prompt encoder, light++ prompt and image decoder.\nImport thing to note: for faster inference, the encoder can be hosted online on server, but prompt encoder and decoder can be hosted on edge (eg. browser). Hence reducing the network latency. ++ We need to encode only once, then we can prompt it as many times as needed.\nSAM predicts multiple masks for single image (to battle confusion)\nImage Encoder: Image encoder is pretrained ViT from MAE (Masked Auto-Encoders are Scalable Vision Learners). In MAE, random patches from ViT are masked and an autoencoder is trained to predict the masked patch.\nSAM uses this MAE encoder as its base encoder\nPrompt Encoder:\nText: Encoded using CLIP\nBounding box coordinates or point coordinates: Positional Encoder with summed learned embedding\nMask: Embedding from CNN\nMask Decoder:\nInspired from original Transformer decoder. (modified)\nOutput of decoder goes to dynamic prediction head\nUses self-attention and cross-attention between prompt and image-embedding in bi-directional way (i.e prompt-to-image embedding and vice-versa)\nLater, up-sample and pass it to a linear classifier\nAmbiguity and Backprop: For each input, 3 masks are predicted and during backprop for loss computation, the mask with least amount of loss is counted. Loss is computed using IoU.\nEfficiency: Post encoder embedding, the prompt encoder and decoder can work on CPU (web-browser) with 50 ms latency.\nLoss metrics used: Focal loss and Dice Loss\nFocal Loss: Focal Loss is am improved version of Cross-Entropy Loss that tries to handle the class imbalance problem by down-weighting easy negative class and focusing training on hard positive classes. In paper, Focal Loss is mathematically defined as: Reference: Understanding Cross-Entropy Loss and Focal Loss | Multiplying Matrices for a living (theguywithblacktie.github.io)\r(Do read it, very good explanation) Note: Focal loss was initially used for object detection (invented at FAIR)\nDice Loss: Dice loss is 1 - Dice Coefficient. You can directly imagine Dice Coefficient as IoU.\nDataset\r#\rDataset and Data-Engine: 11 mil images, 1 billion masks.

Caching:\r#\rIf same request is repeated multiple times \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; cache hence no need to recompute or hit the DB again.\nFor DB, its: MemCacheD or Redis\n2. Connection Pooling:\r#\rHaving continues connections with DB can slow down server as each connection requires a lot of handshake protocol. Hence, it s a good practice to already have a set of connections ready with each set of API. This is difficult in serverless applications like Lambda and can cause big problems:\nSolution (at-least on AWs): RDS Proxy:- It sits between DB and applications (including AWS Lambda) to efficiently manage the DB connections\n3. N+1 query problem:\r#\rIdeally, we should fetch data in a single request to Db instead of asking or querying it N times. Conclusion being, we should try to club requests to query our DB. 4. Pagination:\r#\rIf data to be fetched or requested from DB or server is huge, it will slow the response time \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Hence we should paginate our response into multiple pages to reduce data transfer in single go.\n5. Json Serialization:\r#\rSerialization takes time \u0026hellip;hence consider ways to reduce that time\nExample: Can think of using gRPC or some json serialization library which is very fast.\n6. Compress API response payloads to reduce network latency.\r#\rGitHub - google/brotli: Brotli compression format\rVarious CDN also perform these tasks example: Cloudfare\n7.
